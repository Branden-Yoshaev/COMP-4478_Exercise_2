# COMP-4478_Exercise_2

My game has the fish net and fish and bombs dropping down. The left and right arrow keys control the movement of the net to catch the fish and avoid the bombs. The fish and bombs drop randomly but with 80% fish and 20% bombs. On the top right of the screen, we have the score counter every time you catch a fish your score increases by one. Once the bomb is caught the game stops with a Game Over text and has a button underneath to Restart the game. Once restart is pressed the game restarts and the score does and you get the fish and bombs dropping down randomly.
